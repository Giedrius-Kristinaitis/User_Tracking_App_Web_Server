# Instructions file explained

The file must contain a JSON array populated with objects with 2 properties:

Name - the key to press (can be multiple keys to be pressed in a sequence (delay will be applied only for the first key))

Delay - key press delay time in milliseconds

All instructions are executed in sequence right after the instruction file is downloaded by the application
